This project is about the retrieval of data using the Bungie API about the videogame Destiny 2, as 
well as display the data in the form of an intuitive website. Research was done on similar websites, 
showing that whilst plentiful data was shown, there is a clear lack of graphs and charts when 
displaying data as well as innovative features. A website was built with these requirements in mind, 
using Python and Flask in PyCharm. This was done by using GET request to retrieve data from the 
endpoints resulting a positively received that meets the main objectives.
